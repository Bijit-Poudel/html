<h2> What is the Internet? </h2>
<font size = "+2">
<p>The Internet is a global network of computers that use the TCP/IP protocol to communicate with each other. It is a vast system of interconnected networks that allows people to share information, communicate, and access a wide range of resources. The Internet can be thought of as a giant web, with each computer or device serving as a node on the network. When you connect to the Internet, you are essentially plugging your device into this web, allowing you to access the vast amount of information and resources that are available online. The Internet is made possible by a set of standards and protocols, known as the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP). These protocols define how data is formatted and transmitted across the network, ensuring that all devices can communicate with each other regardless of their hardware or software.</p>

<h2>History of the Internet</h2>

<font size = "+2">
<p>The Internet was born out of the Cold War era as a way for scientists to share information. In 1969, the first four computers were connected to each other via ARPANET, the precursor to the Internet. The network grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, and by the 1990s, it was accessible to the general public. </p>
<p>By the 1980s, ARPANET was joined by others, forming the internet we know today. The TCP/IP protocol suite became the standard communication language, allowing diverse networks to connect and share resources. The 1990s witnessed a revolution with Tim Berners-Lee's invention of the World Wide Web. Hypertext documents and web browsers made accessing information easier than ever, leading to the internet's explosive growth. The 21st century saw the internet become an essential part of daily life. Search engines like Google and Yahoo! simplified information access, while social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter connected people globally. Today, the internet continues to evolve rapidly, with new technologies and applications like mobile internet, the internet of things (IoT), and artificial intelligence constantly emerging, shaping the future of our lives and interactions.</p>

<h2>How the Internet Works</h2>
<img src="/Users/subham/Desktop/TCP:IP.jpeg" alt="TCP/IP protocol" align = 'right'>
<font size = "+2">
<p>
    The internet is like a giant network of interconnected roads and highways. Your computer is like a car, and your Internet Service Provider (ISP) is like a toll booth. When you want to visit a website, your computer sends a request to the website's server. This request is broken down into small packets of data, like cars traveling on different lanes of the highway. These packets travel through different routers and switches, which are like traffic lights and junctions, until they reach the website's server. Once the packets arrive, they are reassembled and the website sends back a response, which follows the same path back to your computer. This process happens incredibly fast, allowing you to browse the internet seamlessly.</p>
